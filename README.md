# JHipster e-commerce microservices definitions

Repository containing JDL definitions of e-commerce microservice based service.  
All JDL schemas existing in this repository are heavily based on official samples published under this [git repository](https://github.com/jhipster/jdl-samples).

### Code generation 

To generate all services just go to the directory where you store JDL definitions and execute below command:

```shell script
jhipster import-jdl <JDL-FILE>
```
